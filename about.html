									Philosophy of Ministry</h1>
								</header>

								<h2>Our Calling</h2>
								<P>As the Church of Jesus Christ, we believe we are called to reach the unchurched, 
									the dechurched, and the prodigal sons and daughters, so that we may:  </P>
									<ol>
										<li>demonstrate love;</li>
										<li>make disciples;</li>
										<li>develop spiritual gifts for ministry; and</li>
										<li>invite all born again Christians to participate in God's realization of His Kingdom.</li>
									</ol>
								<h2>Ministry Philosophy</h2>
								<p>As the Church of Jesus Christ, we are convicted to be a church that strives to:</p>
								<dl>
									<dt>
										1. Be accepting of all peoples and maintain the dignity of all creation: from the East 
										through the West; from the cradle to the grave; from the least to the greatest.
									</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											God had created us so that we may enjoy an intimate and reciprocal fellowship with Him and 
											fellow creation. There is desire in us to be loved and to love. 
										</p>
										<p>
											We are a Church that is called to love—love God, love our neighbors, love ourselves, and love
											the planet we live in. Jesus explicitly links discipleship as the chief outward 
											sacramentality of love (John 13:35). Being disciples of Christ means that we are called to
											love one another, because love is made known to everyone that has been born of God
											and knows God. Indeed, our loving of others is indicative of the reality that we
											acknowledge that God had loved us first (1 John 4:19), and if we fail to love our brothers,
											sisters, and the rest of creation, we lie about our faith (1 John 4:20). Therefore, we are a
											church that not only accepts all people of all stages, culture, ethnicity, and challenges of
											life, but we are a church that strives consciously to embrace and love all peoples. 
										</p>
										<p>
											We acknowledge that we live in a broken and fallen world. Therefore, those who live in it, even 
											the saints of the Church, can never be perfect until God’s full consummation that will 
											come at the end of time. Because we are fellow servants of God, we reserve judgement
											for God and God alone and understand that our primary <i>telos</i> on earth is to love and
											accept each other as we love ourselves. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Yet, we understand that we have a responsibility to encourage mutual sanctification in Christ. 
											The Spirit enables us to live a holy life, and as witnesses of Christ it is our responsibility 
											to reflect our inward holiness in our outward living. As iron sharpens iron, we commit to 
											sharpening our brothers and sisters so that we may be pleasing to the eyes of God 
											(Proverbs 27:17).
										</p>
										<p>
											We recognize the mystery of God, and we only know what has been revealed to us through the 
											life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and what is recorded in Scripture. 
											We strive to exegete what the Scripture means for us in the 21st century, but we 
											recognize that all of God’s Word and Will is sometimes unfathomable or indecipherable. 
											God is not put in a facile box that we can unpack and retrofit into our context. And during 
											ambiguous situations, we--the church of Jesus Christ, will err on the side of love, trusting 
											that that is God’s call for His people.
										</p>
										<p>
											Loving our neighbour is not a passive declaration but a constant active effort of praying for and 
											working so that God’s will might be done on earth as it is in heaven. God wants humanity 
											and all of creation to flourish (John 10:10). The church is a representative of God who is 
											called to go out and confront societal evils that systemically stifle shalom in their own 
											lives and in the lives of others. This includes contributing to closing the gap between the 
											dominators and the marginalized today, whether it be social, political, economic, or 
											environmental justice; as we wait expectantly for Christ’s second coming when He will 
											rule in peace and justice. 
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>
										2. Actively pursue discipleship in Jesus Christ.
									</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											Being a disciple means embracing and demonstrating attributes, characteristics, attitudes, and 
											practices that align Christians towards the direction of God, who is willingly participates in 
											God’s mission to serve and transform the world. In following and worshiping God, being 
											witnesses and forgivers to the world, and being a neighbour, prophet, and steward to 
											those around us, we are effectively imitating Christ.<a href="#section1">[1]</a> Therefore, when we become a 
											presence of God to those around us, our lived lives become the very signs of God’s 
											invisible grace to all of creation. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Disciples are followers of Jesus Christ. The life of discipleship is a journey of learning who Jesus 
											is by being born again through receiving the gospel, then ultimately, living to imitate Christ 
											as living sacrifices. We give Lordship to Christ and submit ourselves to his authority (1 
											Cor.15:28). Discipleship begins with receiving the gospel as truth and pursuing a godly 
											life that is revealed to us through the divine text. Discipleship involves an active pursuit 
											of understanding, communion and relationship with Christ.
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>
										3. Acknowledge the craftsmanship of the Father; cultivate the gifts of the Holy Spirit; 
										belong to the Body of Christ.
									</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											The Church is the body of Christ, to which all believers belong (1 Cor. 12:12-14). The Holy Spirit 
											discerns the gifts that are needed for the flourishing of the church and the broader 
											community. While the gifts are given to the members of the body, these gifts are also 
											indirectly presented to the community outside of the church through the lived lives of 
											Christians. 
										</p>
										<p>
											We are all products of the Father’s craftsmanship (Eph. 2:10) and are fashioned with 
											constellations of gifts that are individually unique. These individually discerned gifts 
											come together to serve a single purpose: so that the church can holistically function for 
											the works of Jesus Christ (Eph. 4:1-16). The body of Christ mobilizes in unity with 
											the goal of participating in God’s continuous work of realizing the Kingdom of God on 
											earth as it is in heaven. In doing so, we become faithful stewards of the gifts that God has 
											entrusted to us (Matt. 25:14-29).
										</p>
										<p>
											We, as the church, are convicted and called to proliferate the gifts of each member of the body 
											by discerning, developing, and renewing the joy of these gifts so that each member can 
											find their vocational identity, worth, value, belonging, and joyful participation in the broader 
											body of Christ. 
										</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>
										4. Participate in God’s mission to the world in reconciling all peoples in relationship with 
										Him and the restoration and flourishing of all creation.
									</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>
											In the beginning, God created the universe and all that is in it. He meant for the universe to be full 
											of life and goodness. He saw that it was good. He created humanity in His likeness, 
											reflecting the Triune God, and blessed humanity to reflect the imago Dei, that we might 
											care for and enjoy Creation. Being faithful stewards of the world meant being subject to 
											God’s lordship. But we brought brokenness into the world by rebelling against God and 
											insisting that we be our own gods. We have been separated from God because of our 
											sin. Yet, because God created us to be in a loving perichoretic relationship with us, God 
											constantly missions to us so that we may be reconciled to Him. Throughout history, God 
											called on believers to join in and participate in His mission to the world. Participating in 
											God’s mission, therefore, is the foundation of the church. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Our missional objectives are found in Scripture: Luke 4:16-20, Matt. 28:18-20, and Acts 1:8. As 
											the church, we commit to witnessing the saving works of Jesus Christ, making disciples, 
											baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and 
											teaching them to obey Jesus’ instructions--all the while maintaining dignity and the full 
											humanity of each person whom we engage with.
										</p>
										<p>
											“<i>The Church exists by mission, just as a fire exists by burning. Where there is no mission, there 
											is no Church; and where there is neither Church nor mission, there is no faith,</i>” -Emil Brunner. 
											Rather than falling into the temptation of self-preservation, being preoccupied with 
											forecasting the death of the church and hoarding resources and energy, we are called to 
											proclaim good news to the poor; proclaim freedom for the prisoners; recover sight for the 
											blind; set the oppressed free; and proclaim the good news of the Lord’s favour to the 
											world (Luke 4:16-20). 	
										</p>
										<p>
											Ministry is concerned with the flourishing of humanity as God sees it. Jesus taught his 
											disciples to be anthropocentric missionaries. Jesus did not only forgive sinners and 
											preach the good news, but he also healed the sick, cast out demons, fed the hungry, 
											clothed prostitutes, welcomed children, and restored the dignity of sinners. We cannot 
											just care for the spiritual health of people while disregarding their dignity, culture, 
											and differences, but we must also be concerned with their emotional, physical, and 
											mental wholeness. The church is responsible for making the gospel known, but she is 
											also responsible for living out the gospel by using her resources for the purposes of 
											proliferating the flourishing and dignity of all creation.
