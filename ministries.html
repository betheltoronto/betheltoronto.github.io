								<h2 id="bible">Bible Study</h2>
								<p>
									Our weekly Bible Studies continue to run through COVID-19 online through Zoom.
									During the Bible studies, members are encouraged to ask challenging theological 
									questions in the safe and confidential space we create. We occasionally hold Q&A 
									sessions to further advocate this safe space.
								</p>
								<p>
									Depending on the interests of those who are attending, we select a book from Scripture 
									and do a thorough study. The books we’ve studied in 2020 include:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Amos</li>
									<li>1 Thessalonians</li>
									<li>2 Thessalonians</li>
									<li>Esther</li>
									<li>Acts</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									Please contact Casey for more information.

								<h2 id="disciple">Discipleship Training</h2>
								<p>
									Started just this year, discipleship is cementing itself as a core ministry of Bethel.
									Here's what it means for us and what you can expect:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										Vision:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<b>Grow.</b> To make disciples of Christ, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit, 
												learning to become the perfect image of Christ. Disciples first need to learn 
												what it means to be like Christ by receiving the gospel.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Equip.</b>Have every member of the church join and participate in at least 
												one of the Core Ministries. Disciples are not idle members of the church that 
												are present on Sundays. Disciples are active members of the body of Christ who 
												participate in the full mobilization of the body of Christ by discerning, 
												developing, and using their spiritual gifts for ministry.
											</li>
											<li>
												<b>Send.</b>Disciples of Christ are called by Christ and sent into the world. 
												Disciples must participate in God’s mission to the world.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										Structure:
										<ul>
											<li>Receive discipleship training.</li>
											<li>Discern & develop spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit has discerned for us.</li>
											<li>Active disciples recognized with deaconship.</li>
											<li>Deacons given responsibility and commissioned to continue to create disciples 
												within the church.</li>
											<li>Deacons given responsibility and commissioned to create disciples outside the 
												bound of the church & being active community members.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Please contact the leadership team for more information.</p>
								</article>

								<article class="post">
								<h2 id="small">Small Groups</h2>
								<dl>
									<dt>Purpose and Vision:</dt>
										<dd>
											<P>To create an intimate environment of trust and safety where members of the church can share 
												and belong. </P>
											<p>Small groups meet regularly for Bible study, fellowship, prayer support, and accountability. 
												The small groups will act as the members’ core support system in times of crises. </p>
											<p>The function of small groups is to integrate new believers into a vivid community, 
												encouraging all its members to engage in discipleship and growing in faith. </p>
											<p>
												Small groups get together to form a large congregation to participate in: Sunday 
												morning worship services, retreats, mission trips, fellowship nights, and extra-Sunday 
												worship events. 
											</p>
											<p>The small groups assist the church in mobilizing its members in ministry.</p>
										</dd>

									Bethel's worship team is responsible for leading the congregation in an intimate time or praise
									and worship to God.  We welcome any musicians of any talent level to let us know if you are 
									interested in being a part of the team!
								</p>

									To be a part of the worship team, it is required for all members to commit at least a year
									of service on the team.  You will also have to be an active member of the church of at

								<article class="post">
								<h2 id="youth">Youth</h2>
								<p>
									Our Youth Ministry, sometimes informally referred to as "BYG" (Bethel Youth Group), meets
									with EM together for Sunday service.  We are currently developing a ministry dedicated to
									the youth that will have programming and events dedicated to them.
								</p>
								<p>Youth ministry includes those from grade 7 to 12.</p>
								<p>Bethel youth can look forward to Vision X every March Break (likely canceled again for 2021).</p>
								<p>Stay tuned for more information!</p>

								<article class="post">
								<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>
								<p>
									Bethel has been serving Constance Lake First Nation, a native reserve roughly ten hours 
									north of Toronto, for over 15 years.  Programming includes VBS and organized sports and activities
									for children and youth, and targeted ministries for adults and the elderly.  We are always looking
									for members of our congregation to join our team!
